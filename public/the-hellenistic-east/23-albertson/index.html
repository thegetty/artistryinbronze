      "description": "The Roman-Syrian city of Palmyra is well known for its extensive corpus of surviving sculpture carved in the locally quarried limestone, dating from the early first century to the middle of the third century AD. Although bronze statuary was subordinate to stone as the Palmyran sculptor’s medium of choice, surviving fragments and inscriptional evidence document its existence in the city. However, an examination of Palmyran sculpture reveals that local artists included in their repertoire of stone-carving certain forms drawn from bronze prototypes and that these borrowings are more extensive than previously thought.The more obvious features are incised grooves outlining the lips, deepened grooves beneath the corners of the mouth, and the sharply defined corkscrew curls with pointed tips found in male hairstyles. Additional features, previously attributed to Near Eastern traditions of stone-carving, may also be included among the group originating in bronze-working. One is the incision of the eyebrows as a herringbone pattern; another is the hollowing out of the iris as a circular cavity with a flat base, clearly intended for the insertion of a different material, which can now be identified as blue glass paste. All these features can be traced to the tradition of Graeco-Roman bronze statuary.The Palmyran distinction is that the number of examples depicting these features drawn from bronze-working are relatively few and each adaption is chronologically short-lived and not necessarily contemporary, suggesting that their borrowing was not wholesale but selective, probably the result of decisions made by individual artisans or workshops.",

      "description": "The papers in this volume derive from the proceedings of the nineteenth International Bronze Congress, held at the Getty Center and Villa in October 2015 in connection with the exhibition *Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World*. The study of large-scale ancient bronzes has long focused on aspects of technology and production. Analytical work of materials, processes, and techniques has significantly enriched our understanding of the medium. Most recently, the restoration history of bronzes has established itself as a distinct area of investigation. How does this scholarship bear on the understanding of bronzes within the wider history of ancient art? How do these technical data relate to our ideas of styles and development? How has the material itself affected ancient and modern perceptions of form, value, and status of works of art?",

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <div>
      The Roman-Syrian city of Palmyra is well known for its extensive corpus of surviving sculpture carved in the locally quarried limestone, dating from the early first century to the middle of the third century AD. Although bronze statuary was subordinate to stone as the Palmyran sculptor’s medium of choice, surviving fragments and inscriptional evidence document its existence in the city. However, an examination of Palmyran sculpture reveals that local artists included in their repertoire of stone-carving certain forms drawn from bronze prototypes and that these borrowings are more extensive than previously thought.</p>

<p>The more obvious features are incised grooves outlining the lips, deepened grooves beneath the corners of the mouth, and the sharply defined corkscrew curls with pointed tips found in male hairstyles. Additional features, previously attributed to Near Eastern traditions of stone-carving, may also be included among the group originating in bronze-working. One is the incision of the eyebrows as a herringbone pattern; another is the hollowing out of the iris as a circular cavity with a flat base, clearly intended for the insertion of a different material, which can now be identified as blue glass paste. All these features can be traced to the tradition of Graeco-Roman bronze statuary.</p>

<p>The Palmyran distinction is that the number of examples depicting these features drawn from bronze-working are relatively few and each adaption is chronologically short-lived and not necessarily contemporary, suggesting that their borrowing was not wholesale but selective, probably the result of decisions made by individual artisans or workshops.

<p>The prosperity experienced by the elite of the ancient Roman-Syrian city of Palmyra from the late first century BC through the middle of the third century AD is perhaps most visible in their monumental family tombs and the funerary sculpture associated within these tombs. Among the types included within the well-known repertoire of Palmyran funerary reliefs are the distinctive <em>loculus</em> plaques: rectangular limestone slabs covering the burial cavity, carved in high relief with a bust depicting the individual interred and often accompanied by an Aramaic inscription denoting the occupant’s name, family lineage, and sometimes even the date of death. By about AD 200, the so-called “large banquet relief” and sarcophagi had also become mainstays within the Palmyran tomb.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Palmyra’s wealth attracted and supported an active artistic community specializing in the carving of stone, specifically the locally quarried limestone. Yet this is a group that did not exist prior to the late first century BC and therefore had no previous local tradition from which to draw. The evolution of Palmyran sculpture and its portraiture is thus characterized by the borrowing of features from outside sources and the adaptation of forms and techniques to meet local tastes. Argued here is that one of these outside sources was contemporary Graeco-Roman bronze statuary.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The physical evidence for the presence of bronze statuary at Palmyra is sparse. Only a handful of fragments remain: a sandaled foot with part of the lower leg from the Sanctuary of Bel; a section of drapery, a hand, and two feet clad in Parthian shoes from the Agora; and a miniature bust of a priest found in the Sanctuary of Nabû.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> The context would suggest that the use of bronze was normally confined to honorific statues erected in prominent public areas. A better claim for the wider use of bronze statuary at Palmyra comes from the Tariff Law of AD 137, specifically lines 128–30, which state that bronze statuary coming into the city was to be taxed the same as ordinary bronze, that is, one statue to be taxed based on half of its weight, two statues by the weight of one.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> These lines would seem to imply that bronze statues were being imported into the city in significant numbers, requiring them not only to be taxed but also to be qualified as to the manner by which they should be taxed.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>An examination of the surviving corpus of Palmyran sculpture, particularly that originating from a funerary context and dealing with images of the deceased, would strongly suggest that certain techniques employed on metal were then imitated and adapted by local stone carvers. The features examined here are limited to those that can be documented in works of bronze and are markedly absent in Roman marble sculpture. Such features occur in some 60 to 70 pieces, out of a surviving corpus of some 2,000 examples of Palmyran funerary sculpture.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>One prominent bronze feature seen in Palmyran stone sculpture is the incision of the eyebrows into a distinct herringbone pattern, sometimes referred to as caterpillar eyebrows (<a href="#fig-23-1">figs. 23.1–2</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:7"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> One might be tempted to propose a Near Eastern origin for such a rendering of the brows; portraits of Gudea of Lagash instantly come to mind.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:8"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> However, there is no evidence to document a continuity of such a form from the late third millennium BC to the early first millennium AD in the sculpture of the ancient Near East. Instead there are more obvious and chronologically closer examples of incised herringbone eyebrows in Graeco-Roman bronze statuary. Among the examples is a series of Gallo-Roman heads from the first century AD, including two bronze busts depicting male youths now in the Getty Villa (<a href="#fig-23-3">figs. 23.3–4</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> These can be supplemented by the bronze Doryphoros from the mid-first-century BC context of the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:10"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> Within the realm of earlier Greek bronze statuary, the technique can be traced back through the Hellenistic to the late Classical period, as evidenced by the bronze head of a boxer from Olympia.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:11"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></p>

<p>A second feature found in Palmyran limestone sculpture that was certainly borrowed from contemporary bronze sculpture is the use of glass paste for the iris and pupil, in place of the more common incised iris and drilled pupil, which were then painted. As seen on the so-called Beauty of Palmyra in Copenhagen, a <em>loculus</em> plaque belonging to an anonymous Palmyran matron carved approximately AD 200–210, what normally remains is a large circular cavity with an inner flattened surface (<a href="#fig-23-5">fig. 23.5</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:12"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> The flat surface of the cavity has caused scholars to speculate that such eyes when seen in Palmyran sculpture originally would have had inserted irises of another material.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:13"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup> This assumption has proved to be correct, for among the series of ten surviving examples, one retains its original inserted eyes: a female head in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (<a href="#fig-23-6">fig. 23.6</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:14"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> The extensively pitted material is glass paste, and its color, which appears black at first glance, is actually a dark blue. The insertion of the eyes as a separate entity has a long tradition in Greek statuary, but the insertion of only a circular iris has its best parallels in contemporary Roman statuary, most notably a series of Gallo-British examples, best illustrated by a recently discovered head of Marcus Aurelius now in the Ashmolean Museum (<a href="#fig-23-7">fig. 23.7</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:15"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup> The fact that this technique may have been popular regionally in southeast Britain and northern Gaul does not rule out that the source is external and chronologically earlier. A bronze head of Hadrian, originally discovered in the Thames near London and currently in the British Museum, shows the method employed in official portraits of the emperors.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:16"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup> Two Etruscan bronze portraits of male youths from Fiesole dating to the third century BC may be the evidence needed to trace this bronze-working method back to Italy.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:17"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup></p>

<p>The third feature associated with Graeco-Roman bronze sculpture and adopted into Palmyran stone sculpture is the finely incised bordering of the lips, physically enhancing the vermilion border and often with a triangular recession denoting the depression between the lobes of the lower lip (see <a href="#fig-23-6">fig. 23.6</a>). This technique is nearly absent in Roman marble portraiture but well known in bronze, as seen on the Croatian Apoxyomenos.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:18"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> This form in metalworking is surely intended to denote a separation of what would be copper lips from the surrounding bronze flesh, and its origins may stem from an early period when the mouth could be cast separately.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:19"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:19">19</a></sup></p>

<p>While it seems clear that contemporary bronze statuary was the source for certain features seen in Palmyran limestone sculpture, perhaps the more intriguing questions are when and why this influence occurred. Here we are fortunate in that the methodology exists to date each example of Palmyran funerary sculpture relatively securely to within a 20–25 year span. Such a process is made possible by the existence of examples in which the date of the deceased’s death, and presumably then the date of the relief’s carving, is given in the accompanying inscription.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:20"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:20">20</a></sup> The formulation of an absolute chronology is further assisted by intact tomb groups, where the genealogical context allows each funerary relief to be assigned to its respective generation.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:21"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> These datable examples then serve as chronological data points and, through a process of stylistic and typological comparison, allow the majority of undated examples to be dated. Consequently, a review of the chronology of those individual features discussed so far—herringbone eyebrows, inserted glass pastes for irises, and engraved lips—helps to shed light on the rationale behind the adoption of such features by Palmyran workshops.</p>

<p>Incised herringbone-shaped eyebrows can be documented on at least thirty-two examples at Palmyra (see Appendix 1). The form appears shortly after the middle of the second century. The earliest documented instance is the dated bust of ’Atê’aqab, in Istanbul, whose inscription gives AD 157 as the year of death.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22">22</a></sup> However, half of the examples cluster roughly between the years AD 180 and 210. After about AD 210, only a handful of examples appear. The last dated example is the relief of Ḥaggûr, son of Malkû, in the American University Museum, Beirut, inscribed AD 236–37.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:23"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:23">23</a></sup> Of note is the fact that all the known examples represent males, suggesting that Palmyran sculptors consciously saw this manner of rendering the eyebrows as a gender signifier. In addition, at Palmyra the apex of the chevron of each individual eyebrow is pointed toward the bridge of the nose (see <a href="#fig-23-2">fig. 23.2</a>), unlike that of any possible Mesopotamian or Graeco-Roman antecedent where the opposite direction is maintained (see <a href="#fig-23-4">fig. 23.4</a>). This suggests a distinctively Palmyran adaptation of the form.</p>

<p>An inserted glass-paste iris and pupil makes its appearance within the Palmyran repertoire of forms in about AD 200. The Beauty of Palmyra in Copenhagen is the earliest (see <a href="#fig-23-5">fig. 23.5</a>). One fragmentary <em>loculus</em> plaque of a woman<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:24"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:24">24</a></sup> and three female heads, all probably originating from large banquet reliefs and including the example in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (see <a href="#fig-23-6">fig. 23.6</a>),<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:25"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:25">25</a></sup> fall into the period around AD 200–220. The other five remaining examples are male; all are heads originally belonging to either statues or large banquet reliefs, and all date to about AD 230–50, more likely later in this period than earlier.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:26"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:26">26</a></sup> Glass-paste eyes thus show an initial appearance in the Palmyran sculptors’ repertoire around AD 200–220, restricted at first to female portraiture. Then, perhaps after a brief pause, they reappear on male portraits for a short time toward the middle of the century.</p>

<p>The earliest documented use of incisions bordering and detailing the lips at Palmyra is from “the month of Ṭebet 466” (January AD 155), the date found on the inscription accompanying the <em>loculus</em> plaque of Bênnûr, son of Bar’â, in the Louvre.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:27"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:27">27</a></sup> If we follow the examples listed by Gunhild Ploug, in her catalogue of Palmyran sculpture in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, this relief and six others can be placed chronologically within the period of approximately AD 150–70.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:28"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:28">28</a></sup> Eight of her examples fall in the later decades of AD 170–90.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:29"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:29">29</a></sup> The fashion then quickly fades, with few examples appearing after about AD 200. It ultimately disappears by about AD 220.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:30"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:30">30</a></sup></p>

<p>Our ability to date Palmyran sculpture rather accurately provides us with an unexpected result when dealing with the proposed influences of bronze on stone. One might expect the influence of bronze statuary to have a collective role; in other words, all the features with bronze antecedents making an appearance simultaneously, then existing side by side to some extent, and ultimately falling out of fashion altogether. Yet at Palmyra this is not the case. Incised lip outlines reach their highpoint of popularity around AD 170–90, then rapidly drop out of use. Incised herringbone eyebrows come into existence around the same time, and show the greatest period of use around AD 180–210, when the lip outlining is already on the decline. Glass-paste eyes appear some fifty years after the other bronze-working features, reaching a peak of popularity around AD 230–50, long after the others have essentially dropped out of use.</p>

<p>Surviving examples thus suggest that the borrowing from bronze statuary was not a wholesale process but one that was done piecemeal. Isolated, individual features were adopted from bronze-working and inserted into what remained a predominantly limestone tradition of carving. In addition, it is extremely rare for more than two of the bronze-derived features to appear together on the same portrait. Only two or perhaps three examples from the entire corpus of Palmyran funerary sculpture fall into this category, the head in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art being one.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:31"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:31">31</a></sup> One could speculate that the allusion to bronze conferred a loftier status on the deceased’s image in stone. The large majority of the examples showing the influence of bronze-working fall into the category of “finer” works, that is, those characterized by a greater attention to detail, a softer modeling of features, and an overall finished appearance. Nevertheless, the chronology supports the idea that the process of selecting features from bronze statuary was random. This eclectic selection process in fact reflects the Palmyran sculptors’ entire approach. Analysis of Palmyran funerary reliefs has revealed that the sculptor began with a concept of a “portrait,” which the sculptor drew from a pre-established repertoire of forms. These forms guided the means of rendering the garments and the arrangement of their folds, the positioning of arms and hands, and the selection of attributes and personal adornment such as jewelry or hairstyle.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:32"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:32">32</a></sup> Even what would normally be considered the distinct, individualized features of the subject—the facial features—are forms repeated from one portrait to another. This strict dependence on typology in Palmyran funerary sculpture sometimes resulted in the creation of identical images representing two different people and different images representing the same person.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:33"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:33">33</a></sup></p>

<p>The study of Palmyran portraiture shows clearly that there was a continuous process of selection by the artist from a prescribed corpus of forms, perhaps due to the nature of the sculptural environment in which these reliefs were displayed and an emphasis on conveying the identity of the deceased, both as an individual and as a member of a larger community. What perhaps makes Palmyran portraiture so distinct is the fact that this repertoire of forms is constantly being augmented, with new forms drawn externally from Graeco-Roman art, including forms, as shown here, created in imitation of contemporary sculpture cast in bronze.</p>
